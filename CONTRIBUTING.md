# Contributing to Thicc

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Project Status

This project is in its early stages and still experimental. The direction may evolve as development continues, so expect some flux in architecture and features.

## How to Contribute

### Bug Fixes

Found a bug? Feel free to submit a PR directly with the fix.

### New Features

For new features, please **open an issue first** to discuss the idea before writing code. This helps avoid wasted effort if the feature doesn't align with the project's direction or if there's already work in progress on something similar.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Build the project
make build

# Run tests
make test
```

## Submitting PRs

- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Include a clear description of what the PR does

## Expectations

This is a side project, so reviews and responses happen when time allows. There's no guaranteed turnaround time, but contributions are appreciated and will be reviewed.
